# Part 1 - Paper Reading

<img align="right" width="180px" src="./media/header.png">

We will continue our scholarship again in this assignment. We have been thinking quite a bit about how we organize our code to take advantage of locality to improve our performance. One thing we have not gone into full detail on is memory allocators and how they may assist or make it more difficult to have locality. Today's reading will go more into depth on memory management. 


## Paper 1

For this assignment read the following paper: [Mesh: Compacting Memory Management
for C/C++ Applications](./mesh.pdf) [ACM link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3314221.3314582).

Note: That I have included in the going further section a version of the video for this allocator.

### Meta information on the paper

1. [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com/) is a Professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He has done quite a bit of work in systems, runtime systems, and performance.
2. Paper was published in 2019 through SIGPLAN's PLDI conference. PLDI is the premier conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, and one of the top peer-reviewed research conferences among all scientific research..


## Deliverables

1. Edit the [summary1.md](./summary1.md) file with your changes. 
2. (Optional) Upload a .pdf with your annotations.


## Going Further

- There is a presentation on compacting memory using Mesh here: [CppCon 2019: Emery Berger “Mesh: Automatically Compacting Your C++ Application's Memory”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRAP3lBivYM)
